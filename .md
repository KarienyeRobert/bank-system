 # Bank Account Management System in Python

This code implements a simple bank account management system using Python's object-oriented programming paradigm. It consists of two classes: `User` and `Bank`, where `Bank` inherits from `User`.

## `User` Class:
The `User` class serves as the parent class and defines the basic attributes and methods for a user.

### Attributes:
- `name`: Represents the user's name.
- `age`: Represents the user's age.
- `gender`: Represents the user's gender.

### Methods:
- `show_details()`: This method displays the user's personal details, including name, age, and gender.

## `Bank` Class:
The `Bank` class inherits from the `User` class and adds additional attributes and methods specific to bank account management.

### Attributes:
- `balance`: Represents the user's account balance, initialized to 0.

### Methods:
- `deposit(amount)`: This method allows the user to deposit a specified amount into their account. It updates the `balance` attribute accordingly and prints the updated balance.

- `withdraw(amount)`: This method allows the user to withdraw a specified amount from their account. It checks if the withdrawal amount exceeds the available balance and prints an error message if necessary. Otherwise, it updates the `balance` attribute and prints the updated balance.

- `view_balance()`: This method displays the user's personal details (inherited from the `User` class) and their current account balance.

## Code Snippets:

### `User` Class:
```python
class User():
    def __init__( self, name, age, gender):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.gender = gender
        
    def show_details(self) :
     print("Personal Details")
     print("")
     print("Name", self.name)
     print("Age" , self.age)
     print("Gender ", self.gender)
```

### `Bank` Class:
```python
class Bank(User):
    def __init__(self, name, age, gender):
       super().__init__(name, age, gender)
       self.balance = 0

       def deposit(self, amount):
          self.amount = amount
          self.balance =
